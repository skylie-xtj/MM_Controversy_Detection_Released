## Ethical Statement
We gather publicly available video information to investigate its controversial characteristics. In addition to the annotated data, we provide only the links for video downloads. It is explicitly mentioned in our paper how the collected data is utilized and for what purposes. It is important to note that our data is intended solely for academic research and should not be employed outside the scope of academic research contexts.
